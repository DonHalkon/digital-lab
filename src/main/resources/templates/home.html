        <p>Digital Lab is a helper for people working in chemical laboratory.
            It contains tools for experiment planing, control of reactants on shelves, constants
            and formulas handbook, it also calculates reaction conditions and other variables. It
            stores all data about your experiment reactants, products, conditions, yelds, comments,
            photos, spectras and other data. And the main feature of this project: it has grpah database
            to connect your chemical reactions each other. You can share you data with other chemists from other
            labs in your or other organization and create your own knowlage base. It has convenient tools and templates
            for paper writing. We also have mobile app that you can work and correct you current experiment data without
            departing hood or weights.
